# Blimpstream
New Game
This game is going to consist of an event that took place in my life where I had gone down a path that led me to an amphetamine induced cytosis where I saw the future of life here on earth. 
This is what I saw, there were 1000s of blimps in the air that were running on solar energy and never needed to land. 
Humans were attached to phone like screens that were on their face. 
The only way you are able to detach from your screen was if you earned a high roller status. 
Needless to say, there were people inside each of these blimps and they were communicating with people live streaming online and I somehow was not yet connected due to this cytosis I was in. 
The sad truth was that each person was watching streams of other people around the world that were not true, and each Indvidual was chasing that lifestyle they were envisioning on the screen. 
The reality was each, and every single person had a screen attached to their face and everyone was living the same life. 
There wasn't a single person who was living a different life other than me that just woke up in my childhood home and stepped foot outside to a waste land...
